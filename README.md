####This contract will implement the simplest form of a cryptocurrency. 

It is possible to generate coins out of thin air, but only the person that created the contract will be able to do that (it is easy to implement a different issuance scheme). 
Furthermore, anyone can send coins to each other without a need for registering with username and password
All you need is an Ethereum keypair.
